I used mimi.cs.mcgill.ca to test my program. 

- My program is able to run script1.txt, script2.txt, script3.txt, testfile.txt, testfile1.txt

- I assume that the RAM should be clear after a "exec" instruction, and the following "exec" instructions will store instructions in files starting from location 0 in RAM.
